Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. \
We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pa\
in out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstracti\
on, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Lumen, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. A\
ll security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## License

The Lumen framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
